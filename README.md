CSS to improve the Bitbucket pull request review page

The old Bitbucket pull request review page could do with some improvements to make it easier to use.
This is my effort so far.  It's pretty ugly at the moment but I'm working on it!

## What it does
 - Stickies the main PR header to the top of the page
 - Stickies the current file header to the top of the page also
 - Stickies the file list to the right hand side
 - Moves the build status to the main header
 - Removes the + and - from the start of each changed line (you can now copy and paste code without having to manually remove them!)
